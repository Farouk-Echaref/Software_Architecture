# Software Architect Guide
This role focuses on designing, developing, and maintaining the architecture of software applications to ensure they meet business needs, are scalable, secure, and perform efficiently within a given ecosystem.

## Key Areas to Focus On

### 1. **Software Architecture Principles**
- Understand **monolithic vs. microservices** architectures.
- Learn about **hexagonal architecture, domain-driven design (DDD), event-driven architecture**.
- Explore architectural patterns: **MVC, CQRS, layered architecture, clean architecture**.
- Study scalability techniques: **load balancing, caching, database sharding**.

### 2. **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**
- Understand the **principles of SOA**: Loose coupling, reusability, interoperability.
- Learn **SOAP vs. REST vs. GraphQL** and when to use each.
- Study Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) and API Gateway architectures.
- Explore service orchestration and choreography.

### 3. **Cloud and On-Premise Deployments**
- Gain hands-on experience with **Azure** (as mentioned in the job description).
- Learn about **hybrid cloud strategies**, multi-cloud architectures, and containerization (Docker, Kubernetes).
- Explore **serverless computing** and Function-as-a-Service (FaaS).

### 4. **Microservices & API Design**
- Design microservices with best practices: **data consistency, inter-service communication, event-driven architecture**.
- Implement **API versioning, authentication, and rate-limiting**.
- Understand **GraphQL and gRPC** in microservices.
- Study **OpenAPI (Swagger)** for API documentation.

### 5. **Databases (SQL & NoSQL)**
- Learn database design for **scalable systems** (sharding, replication, indexing).
- Compare **SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL) vs. NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra)**.
- Understand **event sourcing** and **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**.

### 6. **Frameworks & Languages**
- While the job mentions **Spring & .NET**, you can leverage your **NestJS and Django** expertise.
- Explore **Spring Boot (Java)** for backend architecture patterns.
- Understand **.NET Core** for enterprise applications.
- Implement projects in **NestJS and Django** showcasing architecture principles.

### 7. **DevOps & CI/CD**
- Set up **CI/CD pipelines** using **Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Azure DevOps**.
- Automate deployments with **Docker, Kubernetes, and Helm**.
- Understand **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible)**.

### 8. **Application Performance & Security**
- Implement **monitoring tools**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack.
- Optimize performance: **caching strategies (Redis, Memcached), async processing (RabbitMQ, Kafka)**.
- Secure applications: **OWASP Top 10, JWT, OAuth, SSO, role-based access control (RBAC)**.

## Hands-on Projects
- **Design & deploy a microservices-based application** (NestJS/Django + Kubernetes + CI/CD).
- **Implement an API Gateway with authentication** (Kong API Gateway, Traefik, or Nginx).
- **Develop a scalable logging & monitoring system** using **Prometheus + ELK**.
- **Build a real-time event-driven system** with **Kafka + NestJS/Django**.
- **Migrate a monolithic Django/NestJS app to microservices architecture**.

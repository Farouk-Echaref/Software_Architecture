### ‚úÖ **1. Synchronous vs Asynchronous**

| Term             | Description                                                                                                                                              | Example                                              |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Synchronous**  | Code runs **step by step**, each operation **waits** for the previous one to complete.                                                                   | `result = doSomething(); doNext(result);`            |
| **Asynchronous** | Code starts an operation and **doesn't wait** for it to finish. It continues with the next task. A callback, promise, or event handles the result later. | `doSomethingAsync().then(result => doNext(result));` |

### ‚úÖ **2. Blocking vs Non-Blocking**

| Term             | Description                                                                                                         | Example                                                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Blocking**     | The **thread waits (is blocked)** until the operation completes.                                                    | `readFileSync('file.txt')` blocks until file is read.      |
| **Non-Blocking** | The **thread doesn't wait** and can do other things. The result is handled later (via callback, event, or promise). | `readFile('file.txt', callback)` lets the thread continue. |

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Confusion**

* **Synchronous ‚â† Blocking**, but they often go together.
* **Asynchronous ‚â† Non-blocking**, but they're often used together too.
* You can have:

  * **Synchronous + Non-blocking** (rare)
  * **Asynchronous + Blocking** (e.g., using thread pool)
  * **Asynchronous + Non-blocking** (ideal in event-driven systems)

### ü§î **Is HTTP request/response always blocking?**

**No**, it **depends on the implementation** and **environment**:

| Case                                        | Blocking?                       | Explanation                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Low-level socket HTTP client (C/Python)** | Often **blocking by default**   | You wait for the full response before continuing.                 |
| **Node.js (fetch, axios)**                  | **Non-blocking + async**        | Uses event loop and Promises.                                     |
| **Python with `requests`**                  | **Blocking**                    | Main thread waits unless you run it in a thread or use `aiohttp`. |
| **Browser JS `fetch()`**                    | **Asynchronous + non-blocking** | Page doesn't freeze; Promise resolves later.                      |

### üß† Summary

| Term             | Meaning                                                          |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Synchronous**  | Waits, runs in order.                                            |
| **Asynchronous** | Starts a task and moves on.                                      |
| **Blocking**     | Thread waits.                                                    |
| **Non-blocking** | Thread is free to do other things.                               |
| **HTTP Request** | Can be **blocking or non-blocking**, depending on how it‚Äôs made. |

### ‚úÖ What is `async/await`?

* `async` and `await` are **syntax sugar** over Promises (or coroutines in Python).
* They **make asynchronous code look synchronous** for easier reading and writing.
* But under the hood, it‚Äôs still **asynchronous and non-blocking** (in most environments like Node.js or modern browsers).

### üîç Is `async/await` Synchronous or Asynchronous?

| Feature               | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Asynchronous** ‚úÖ    | Even though it looks sequential, the `await` statement **doesn‚Äôt block the thread**. Instead, it **suspends** the function and lets the event loop continue running other tasks. |
| **Looks Synchronous** | The code *looks* and *flows* like synchronous code, but behaves asynchronously under the hood.                                                                                   |

### üîç Is `async/await` Blocking or Non-Blocking?

| Feature            | Explanation                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Non-Blocking** ‚úÖ | The thread is **not blocked** while waiting for the awaited operation to finish. The event loop or runtime schedules other tasks during that time. |

### üß† Summary Table

| `async/await` Aspect         | Behavior                          |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Synchronous?                 | ‚ùå No, it's asynchronous.          |
| Blocking?                    | ‚ùå No, it's non-blocking.          |
| Looks synchronous?           | ‚úÖ Yes, for developer readability. |
| Uses Promises or coroutines? | ‚úÖ Yes.                            |

### üß™ Example in JavaScript (Node.js or browser)

```js
console.log("1");

async function doStuff() {
  console.log("2");
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000)); // async, non-blocking
  console.log("3");
}

doStuff();
console.log("4");

// Output order: 1, 2, 4, (wait 1s), 3
```

> `await` doesn‚Äôt block the thread ‚Äî it just **pauses** the async function, allowing other code to run in the meantime.

---

### üß™ Example in Python (`asyncio`)

```python
import asyncio

async def main():
    print("A")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # async, non-blocking
    print("B")

asyncio.run(main())
```

> `await asyncio.sleep(1)` doesn't block the main thread ‚Äî it allows the event loop to keep working.

### üîç Code Breakdown

```js
async function f() {
  let eurToGbp = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // code to fetch latest exchange rate between EUR and GBP
    ...
  });

  var latestRate = await eurToGbp;
  process(latestRate);
}
```

---

### ‚úÖ **What Happens Here**

1. `async function f()`:

   * Declares `f` as an **asynchronous function**.
   * Always returns a **Promise**.

2. `let eurToGbp = new Promise(...)`:

   * This creates a **pending Promise**. You typically resolve it once an asynchronous operation (like an HTTP request) completes.

3. `await eurToGbp;`:

   * This line **pauses execution of the `f()` function** *at this point* **until** the promise `eurToGbp` resolves.
   * ‚ùó **Important**: It **does not block the thread**. It simply **suspends this async function** and lets other code or tasks continue running (non-blocking behavior).
   * Once `eurToGbp` resolves, `latestRate` is assigned the resolved value.

4. `process(latestRate);`:

   * Executes once the Promise is resolved and `await` resumes the function.

### üß† Behavior Table

| Line                  | Async/Sync                           | Blocking/Non-Blocking |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| `async function f()`  | Asynchronous                         | Non-Blocking          |
| `new Promise(...)`    | Asynchronous (manual promise)        | Non-Blocking          |
| `await eurToGbp`      | Asynchronous (pauses function)       | Non-Blocking          |
| `process(latestRate)` | Synchronous (but runs *after* await) | N/A                   |

---

### ‚úÖ Conclusion

* The whole `f()` function is **asynchronous and non-blocking**.
* `await` **waits for the result** but doesn't block the main thread ‚Äî it just pauses the async function until the Promise resolves.
* The rest of your program (other functions, I/O, etc.) continues executing while `eurToGbp` is pending.

# Coupling in Software Design

## ðŸ”— Tightly Coupled

### Definition
When components or services are highly dependent on each other. A change in one often requires changes in the other.

### Characteristics
- Hardcoded dependencies
- Low flexibility and maintainability
- Difficult to test or reuse

### Example (Code)
```python
class Engine:
    def start(self):
        print("Engine starting...")

class Car:
    def __init__(self):
        self.engine = Engine()  # Tight coupling

    def start(self):
        self.engine.start()
```

## ðŸ§© Loosely Coupled

### Definition
Components are independent and interact through well-defined interfaces. They can be modified or replaced without affecting others.

### Characteristics
- Uses dependency injection or abstraction
- High flexibility and maintainability
- Easier to test and extend

### Example (Code)
```python
class Engine:
    def start(self):
        print("Engine starting...")

class Car:
    def __init__(self, engine):
        self.engine = engine  # Loose coupling

    def start(self):
        self.engine.start()
```

# Coupling in Microservices

## ðŸ”— Tightly Coupled Microservices

### Definition
Services depend heavily on each other, often calling one another synchronously or sharing the same database.

### Characteristics
- Shared databases
- Synchronous REST calls
- Hard to deploy independently
- Risk of cascading failures

### Example
```
User Service â†’ Order Service â†’ Payment Service
```
If one service fails, the entire chain can break.

---

## ðŸ§© Loosely Coupled Microservices

### Definition
Services communicate through events or APIs, maintain their own data, and operate independently.

### Characteristics
- Independent databases
- Async communication via message queues (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ)
- Independent deployments
- Higher resilience

### Example (Event-Driven Architecture)
```
Order Service â†’ emits "OrderPlaced" event
Payment Service â†’ listens to "OrderPlaced"
```
Services don't directly depend on one another.
